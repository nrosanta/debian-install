<h3>Here we go, my notes are now up on Github pages after a complete re-write.</h3>
<br><br>

Looking to install Debian Linux? an OS that works 100% of the time, is fast, stable, customisable and very satisfying... if you are, then here are the notes I've made on every step I've taken to get it installed, configured, fixed, running, and enhanced!
<br><br>
Debian is <b>Linux</b> so it's free, and it's open-source which means that developers from around the world are actively contributing to its stability and <b>Debian</b> is possibly the most well tested and supported distro - the basis for Ubuntu and others.... The community is large and help is never far away.  Really, with Debian, the days of a hanging system (chewed up by a RAM-eating system) are gone. It's time to format those Windoze partitions!
<br><br>
You may be familiar with Ubuntu, or Xubuntu. But they come with added bloat. So why wouldn't you prefer to build your own Debian system and keep it light-weight and simple, and fast?  Nothing too fancy or over graphical with effects, but just operable, smooth, productive.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>...</b>
My notes begin on the next page where you can get started by downloading a Netinstall CD or Live CD from the web..
<br><br>
The <b>Debian Net-install CD</b> gets you the base system installed, retrieving it from over the internet. After that, you can install all the other software that you need.  I've kept my package list pretty minimal, and I'm conscious of choosing low-memory consuming apps where possible.
<br><br>
If you're really new to Linux you could get Debian running quite easily by using a <b>Debian live CD </b>with a full Desktop Environment included (though it will be a larger download).
