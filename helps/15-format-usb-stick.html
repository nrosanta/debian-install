</div>
<div>I find this pretty annoying with Debian, when a USB stick decides to go read-only after I've done one or two copy operations to it. &nbsp;Logging out or restarting didn't fix it, restarting Thunar didn't (as sometimes it has).</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>So what's the reason for this? &nbsp;It can be a corrupted file system, I read, that causes the system to see it as an unsafe device, thus it is rendered un-writable. &nbsp;</div>
<div>It <b>doesn't help</b> to pull out a USB drive without clicking on eject in Thunar -even if it appears that all the file transfers have finished.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The fix? &nbsp;I did the following and it worked. &nbsp;But it will wipe off any files on the stick, so c<span style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">opy the files off the stick first if you need them!</span><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">&nbsp;(sdb1 is my usb partition) &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><font color="#6A3200" style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">sudo umount /dev/</font><font color="#0b5394" style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">sdb1</font></div>
<font color="#6A3200">sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/</font><font color="#0b5394">sdb1</font>
<div>remove and re-insert it to test it -this repairs the M-DOS partition table (which can be done in Gparted too).</div>
