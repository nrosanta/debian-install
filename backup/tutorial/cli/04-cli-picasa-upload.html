<div class="cont">

This might not be the nicest way of uploading pics to Picasaweb, but it's simple and it works fine. &nbsp;You'll just have to go to Picasaweb or Google+ to sort out Album properties, sort order and sharing, and fill in photo captions if need be. &nbsp;Yes you can just go there and click on upload, or Add photos, but this method works right from the command line, or from Ranger, before you even open a web browser. &nbsp;So it means you can upload a few directories of pics to Picasaweb and sort them out later on when you have the time.

<div>I got my info from here&nbsp;<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5568817/five-really-handy-google-command-line-tricks">http://lifehacker.com/</a></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>What you need is&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>googlecl <a href="https://code.google.com/p/googlecl/downloads/list">https://code.google.com/p/googlecl/downloads/list</a></div>
<div>gdata-python-client <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/downloads/list">https://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/downloads/list</a></div>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>the first is a .deb archive, so install the usual way, sudo dpkg -i googlecl*.deb</div>
<div>the second one is a tar.gz archive, so unpack it and cd to its dir, set up with</div>
<div><font color="#6A3200">sudo python setup.py install</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>and you are ready to use Google services from command line.</div>
<div>so run a test</div>
<div>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">copy some pics to a test dir</span></li>
<li>cd to the dir or navigate there with Ranger</li>
<li>then run this command</li></ul>
<font color="#6A3200">google picasa create "Test Album" *.JPG</font></div>
<div>
<ul><li>`create` will make a new album, with the title set by the next value</li>
<li>the last value is the pics to be uploaded -so individual files, or wildcard, or /path/to/pics/*</li>
<li>before you can connect to the Google service, you must allow access, which is pretty simple stuff (a browser opens and you enter user/passwd for google)</li>
<li>you won't get any indication of % uploaded, save for the file names of current and done files -so you can work out how far by looking at the file list.</li>
<li>you can post pics or videos to an exiting album with something like</li></ul>
<span style="color:#6A3200">google picasa post "Big Spiders" tarantula21.JPG</span></div>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">also,<font color="#6A3200"> list-albums</font> and <font color="#6A3200">delete "Bad album"</font> could be useful -</span><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.6"> see the google cl page here </span><a href="https://code.google.com/p/googlecl/wiki/ExampleScripts#create" style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">https://code.google.com/p/googlecl/wiki/</a></li>
<li>using ranger, you can use %s instead of file names and that way upload only the selected files (see my key mapping on image files, on my Ranger page)</li>
<li>Thunar custom action? well it would work but without a terminal opened there would be no progress indication whatsoever.</li></ul>
<div><br>
<div>there are other G services you can use too, but I haven't tried any.</div>
